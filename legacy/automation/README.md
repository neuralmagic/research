# ClearML Automation Scripts

This folder contains reference scripts used for automating research flows using ClearML queues and pipelines.
These scripts are meant to be a starting point for researchers to automate their flows.
Users can adapt scripts to their needs as required, but should attempt to follow reference scripts and contribute with improvements as much as possible.

**Notes:**
- Before any script, please make sure to be properly setup with ClearML and Google Cloud ON THE MACHINE IN WHICH THE SCRIPT IS BEING LAUNCHED.
Having completed the setup in one machine only applies to that machine and must be repeated at every machine the user may use to launch jobs.
Preferably, the user should launch jobs from their workstation.
See [here](https://github.com/neuralmagic/internal-docs/blob/clearml/teams/ml-ops/ClearML/Generic/bootstrap.md) for instructions.
