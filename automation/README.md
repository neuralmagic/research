# ClearML Automation Scripts

This folder contains reference scripts used for automating research flows using ClearML queues and pipelines.
These scripts are meant to be a starting point for researchers to automate their flows.
Users can adapt scripts to their needs as required, but should attempt to follow reference scripts and contribute with improvements as much as possible.
